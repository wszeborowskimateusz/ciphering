# University project - file sender with encryption
## Goals:
* create two applications for transferring encrypted files through ethernet connection
* first application should act as a server hosted locally
* second application should act as a client hosted on a VM
* the application should use the AES-256 cipher to encrypt files
* the application should handle all of four cipher modes (ECB, CBC, CFB, OFB)
* the application should use UDP protocol to transfer files
* the application should use the RSA algorithm for handling session key

## Current progress:
* working on UI - Blackweather
